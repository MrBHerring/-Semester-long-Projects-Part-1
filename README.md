This assignment was locked Sep 22 at 11:59pm.
Introduction to the Dataset: The police shootings data to be used in this project is from the database maintained by Washington Post at https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings to an external site. that covers the period 2015-2019.
The variables in this dataset are:

#	Variable/ Attribute/ Feature	Meaning
1	id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, body_camera, year, month, day	Self-Explanatory

Datasets were downloaded on June 11-12, 2020.
Dataset is provided covering the period 2015-2019.
Additionally, this dataset is split into two datasets covering the period 2015-2017 and 2018-2019.

The files are:

All data in single file: cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2015-2019.csvDownload cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2015-2019.csv
Data in two files to be used when single file is too large for your machine: cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2015-2017.csv Download cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2015-2017.csvand cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2018-2019.csvDownload cleaned-police-violence-shootings-2018-2019.csv
Work to be done for this project:

Use the Data Science tools - Python, its libraries, and Jupyter notebooks to answer the following questions: 

Create summary statistics of the data to get a snapshot of the data - mean, median, standard deviation.
Create graphs of number of fatalities, by each race, gender, year, etc.
Create graphs to show distribution by race and by year within each race.
Repeat the previous item but with two other relevant variables of your choice.
Are whites or blacks more prone to dying as a result of police shooting because of mental health issues?
How does whether the victim is armed or unarmed affect the outcome?
You will need to write code in one Jupyter notebook and the code snippets in cells of the notebook must answer each of the above questions. You will need to create a markdown cell before each code cell to explain what you are doing in the following code cell. The notebook must be named Semester-long-Projects-Part-1.ipynb and submitted through the link in this assignment.
